# Covid-19-World-Map

This is a simple COVID-19 Case maps. For both these maps I am using the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins Data </a>. There are two types of maps one is a static map where it simply outputs a maps for a certain variable and the other is a Dynamic Map where it generates a .gif of the total confirmed cases from the time series data.
